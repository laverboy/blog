Don't Make Lame Excuses</h1><div class=post-meta>March 31, 2021</div></header><div class=post-content><p><em>I recently re-discovered &ldquo;The Pragmatic Programmer&rdquo;. I remember reading this as an early software engineer and being really motivated to step up my game. The copy I have was published in 2000 and so reading it now there are some parts that seem a little dated; you can tell the internet was a young thing. However overall it is full to overflowing with good advice and solid suggestions.</em></p><p><em>I thought I might go through the first handful of &lsquo;tips&rsquo; (there are 70 in total) and eek out my thoughts around them and see if there are some new things to learn or to re-learn.</em></p><hr><p>Tip 3:</p><blockquote><p>Provide Options. Don&rsquo;t Make Lame Excuses. Instead of excuses, provide options. Don&rsquo;t say it can&rsquo;t be done; explain what <em>can</em> be done.</p></blockquote><p>This one is mainly about professionalism and responsibility. Some of the hardest things to embody in your day-to-day work and yet probably some of the most important, especially when it comes to your ongoing career.</p><p>Things are never going to go right all the time. Deadlines are going to be missed, mistakes are going to be made and large technical requirements are going to be completely overlooked until the last minute. These things are going to happen whether you like it or not, but it&rsquo;s how you deal with them that counts.</p><p>We&rsquo;ve all had those colleagues who spend more time complaining about how we all do things the wrong way, how if management would let them they would sort it all out. They want to spend too much time dwelling on the issue, why it went wrong and how it isn&rsquo;t their fault. Sometimes, we have to admit, we fall into this habit as well. Sometimes the frustrations get too much and we want to just explode; we did our best, we tried hard but it still didn&rsquo;t work. It&rsquo;s not our fault.</p><p>But this does not help. How do we ensure that this doesn&rsquo;t become us.</p><h3 id=walk-away>Walk away</h3><p>The first thing to do is to gain perspective. I have found the best way to do this is to walk away. Even for a few minutes.</p><p>When we are knee deep in a problem it seems large and insurmountable. At that point panic sets in and that&rsquo;s when we are more likely to blame others and miss the obvious things that we did.</p><p>Don&rsquo;t get blinded by the initial panic and fear. Take a breath. Walk away. Then come back ready to take responsibility but more importanly find a solution.</p><p>###Take Responsibility</p><p>The first step in solving a problem is knowing what the problem is. If there was some thing that you did or didn&rsquo;t do that led to the current issue then admit it; to yourself and others. If you&rsquo;re not sure, then talk to others that you trust and find out. The goal here is to find what specifically went wrong or what was missed so that we can learn from it.</p><p>Taking responsibility is a sure sign of a mature programmer. Stand up, say &ldquo;it was me&rdquo;, and then move on to the solutions.</p><blockquote><p>“Those that fail to learn from history are doomed to repeat it.”
Winston Churchill</p></blockquote><h3 id=find-solutions>Find Solutions</h3><p>So how are we going to salvage this situation we find ourselves in.</p><p>One of the biggest solutions and often the most overlooked is &lsquo;asking for help.&rsquo; Sometimes a problem has to occur before you realise that you didn&rsquo;t really have the ability or knowledge to complete the task in the first place. This is the hardest solution to offer but often the best in the long term. There is no quicker route to improvement then trying something yourself and then asking for support to complete it; but it does take a very mature step in the first place to admit that you need help.</p><p>Other options mentioned in the book are throwing code out and refactoring, creating a prototype in order to determine how to proceed. Introducing better testing or automation of testing to catch problems sooner in the future. These are great ideas and I&rsquo;m sure you can think of others based on your experience.</p><p>Problems and errors are always going to be a part of our job. Handling them in a graceful and pragmatic way is they key to progressing your career rather than having it derailed.</p><blockquote><p>We can be proud of our abilities, but we must be honest about our shortcomings - our ignorance as well as our mistakes.</p></blockquote></div></article></main><footer class=footer><span>&copy; 2021 <a href=https://laverboy.github.io/>Matthew Laver</a></span>
