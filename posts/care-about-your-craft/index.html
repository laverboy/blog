I remember reading this as an early software engineer and being really motivated to step up my game. The copy I have was published in 2000 and so reading it now there are some parts that seem a little dated; you can tell the internet was a young thing. However overall it is full to overflowing with good advice and solid suggestions.</p><p>I thought I might go through the first handful of &lsquo;tips&rsquo; (there are 70 in total) and eek out my thoughts around them and see if there are some new things to learn or to re-learn.</p><p>So tip 1:</p><blockquote><p>Care about your craft. Why spend your life developing software unless you care about doing it well?</p></blockquote><p>They go on to say:</p><blockquote><p>We feel that there is no point in developing software unless you care about doing it well.</p></blockquote><p>This sounds obvious and an easy-ask on the surface. However maintaining that care over a whole career and especially during the inevitable times when your day-to-day work is stressful or painfully mundane is another thing altogether.</p><p>I have been a software engineer since 2005 and I feel like I&rsquo;ve been through quite a lot of this. I have had times when I didn&rsquo;t want to go to work, or even get up in the morning. I&rsquo;ve had times when management was unfairly blaming me for things. I have had times when I was a glorified data entry monkey. But through all of this I found times and strategies to keep learning, keep improving and more importantly still do the best job I could; still care for the work I was doing.</p><p>Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I&rsquo;ve also produced my fair share of stinking messes that I hope never to have to see again. And if you have to work on some of them I am so very sorry.</p><p>However caring about your craft should be indipendant of motivation or inspiritation. Just because you don&rsquo;t feel motivated today, or this week. Just because you&rsquo;re currently under pressure or the opposite, your month is dragging on and on; this shouldn&rsquo;t affect your overall attitude to your work.</p><p>Caring about your craft is not something that is teachable. In some ways you either care about it or you don&rsquo;t. But if you are reading this, if you are currently a programmer of any kind, then I think you probably do care. But maybe you&rsquo;ve forgotten.</p><p>So what can we do to restore that drive, that care for our craft? Well I would suggest that you pick something, something small, and start doing it. Here are some suggestions:</p><ul><li>learn some new keyboard shortcuts for the tool you are using</li><li>learn about code linters and how to apply them to code you have written</li><li>pick up a copy of the pragmantic programmer and read chapter 1</li><li>decide to ask more questions at work: why are we doing this? how does that work? how do other teams do this?</li><li>look back at the last code you wrote and see if you can improve it</li></ul><p>It doesn&rsquo;t have to be something big, but each of these items will hopefully trigger further interest. For now just take the first step.</p><p>Dan Pink in his book &ldquo;Drive&rdquo; argues that what really motivates people is doing something because they love it.</p></div></article></main><footer class=footer><span>&copy; 2021 <a href=https://laverboy.github.io/>Matthew Laver</a></span>
