I recently re-discovered "The Pragmatic Programmer". I remember reading this as an early software engineer and being really motivated to step up my game. The copy I have was published in 2000 and so reading it now there are some parts that seem a little dated; you can tell the internet was a young thing. However overall it is full to overflowing with good advice and solid suggestions.

I thought I might go through the first handful of 'tips' (there are 70 in total) and eek out my thoughts around them and see if there are some new things to learn or to re-learn.

Tip 2:

> Think! About your work. Turn off the autopilot and take control. Constantly critique and appraise your work.

I have to admit that this is one of the hardest ones for me. I'm pretty good at finding patterns in my work and then turning those patterns into a workflow which means I very quickly zone out; repeating the same thing over and over again without questioning.

But what is the aim here? The book goes on to say:

> The reward is a more active involvement with a job you love, a feeling of mastery over an increasing range of subjects, and pleasure in a feeling of continuous improvement.

Now that sounds good doesn't it. Mastery of one's craft is a key human motivator. 

So how do we go from drone to active thinker? What can we do each day to start moving towards this better way of working? Well I think it is about little steps. 

The horizon always looks daunting, the sheer amount of things that we think we have to learn and master can be overwhelming. When we look at other software engineers that we admire the gap between us and them seems un-crossable. But it's not, it's just like any other long walk, it's made up of single steps.

### Something is better than nothing

The greatest danger is that the size of the job at hand leads to inaction. So lets reduce the scope of the task to just the next step. What are you going to do next to move towards being a more active thinker? Take some time when you are not at work to remember the times today when you just ran on autopilot. Remember the meetings you were in where you contributed nothing, where you barely listened to what was being said. Just by spotting these situations you make it more likely that next time you will be more aware.

Now what are some things that you can put in place to stop you? I'm sure you can think of some but here are some suggestions:

- make notes - the process of writing something down makes you form what you are hearing into a coherent thought
- ask a question - even the simplest question means that you have to prepare what you are going to say based on what you have been listening to, even echoing back what has been said has value "So what you are saying is..."
- take a break - take smaller breaks more often, when on the break try to think of non-work things, then when you return ask yourself what am I doing and why

### Do the things you want to do

It is easier to be an active thinker when you are working on something that you want to do. Have you got a side project on the go? If not why not? Side projects are great for learning and they are the perfect test area to practice active thinking. 

Further to this try and get put on the jobs at work that most interest you, or the ones that you know will challenge your skills. By definition tasks that you start without knowing how you are going to finish will require more active thought.

If you do get stuck on tasks that are just dull, repetitive and/or mindless then try to work out ahead of time if there is a way to do it better. See if you can spread the task out around other things. Or turn the task into a challenge. Set a timer and see how much you can get done in 25mins.

### Practice

We all know the things that take practice: riding a bike, a sport, learning a musical instrument, but for some reason there a whole bunch of other things that we think we should just be able to do, like: talking to people, writing, thinking. It's just not true though unfortunately. We need to practice.

So what are you going to do today to practice active thinking whilst you work?
