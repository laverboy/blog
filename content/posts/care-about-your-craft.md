summary: Part 1 in a series on "The Pragmatic Programmer". Do you care for your craft? Have you lost your motivation? Lets see if we can learn from those who have gone before us
---

*I recently re-discovered "The Pragmatic Programmer". I remember reading this as an early software engineer and being really motivated to step up my game. The copy I have was published in 2000 and so reading it now there are some parts that seem a little dated; you can tell the internet was a young thing. However overall it is full to overflowing with good advice and solid suggestions.*

*I thought I might go through the first handful of 'tips' (there are 70 in total) and eek out my thoughts around them and see if there are some new things to learn or to re-learn.*

So tip 1:

> Care about your craft. Why spend your life developing software unless you care about doing it well?

They go on to say:

>  We feel that there is no point in developing software unless you care about doing it well.

This sounds obvious and an easy-ask on the surface. However maintaining that care over a whole career and especially during the inevitable times when your day-to-day work is stressful or painfully mundane is another thing altogether.

I have been a software engineer since 2005 and I feel like I've been through quite a lot of this. I have had times when I didn't want to go to work, or even get up in the morning. I've had times when management was unfairly blaming me for things. I have had times when I was a glorified data entry monkey. But through all of this I found times and strategies to keep learning, keep improving and more importantly still do the best job I could; still care for the work I was doing.

Don't get me wrong, I've also produced my fair share of stinking messes that I hope never to have to see again. And if you have to work on some of them I am so very sorry.

However caring about your craft should be indipendant of motivation or inspiritation. Just because you don't feel motivated today, or this week. Just because you're currently under pressure or the opposite, your month is dragging on and on; this shouldn't affect your overall attitude to your work. 

Caring about your craft is not something that is teachable. In some ways you either care about it or you don't. But if you are reading this, if you are currently a programmer of any kind, then I think you probably do care. But maybe you've forgotten.

So what can we do to restore that drive, that care for our craft? Well I would suggest that the route to restoring any love is through small steps. Pick something, anything really, and start doing it. Then that one thing should lead to others and so-on.

Hopefully something small has sprung to mind but if not here are some suggestions:

- learn some new keyboard shortcuts for the tool you are using
- learn about code linters and how to apply them to code you have written
- pick up a copy of the pragmantic programmer and read chapter 1
- decide to ask more questions at work: why are we doing this? how does that work? how do other teams do this?
- look back at the last code you wrote and see if you can improve it

It doesn't have to be something big, but each of these items will hopefully trigger further interest. 

For now just take the first step.
